Use the strategy of the decimal to binary conversion and the bit shift left operation
defined in Project 5 to code a new encryption algorithm. The algorithm
should add 1 to each characterâ€™s numeric ASCII value, convert it to a bit string,
and shift the bits of this string one place to the left. A single-space character in
the encrypted string separates the resulting bit strings.
Solution:

    ....
