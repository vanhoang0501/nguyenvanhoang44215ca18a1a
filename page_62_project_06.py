Problem:
    The kinetic energy of a moving object is given by the formula KE = (1 / 2) mv^2
    where m is the object’s mass and v is its velocity. Modify the program you created
    in Project 5 so that it prints the object’s kinetic energy as well as its momentum.
Solution:
    ....
"""
mass = float(input("Enter mass m is: "))
velocity = float(input("Enter velocity v is: "))
motivation =(1/2) * mass * velocity * velocity
print("motivation: ", motivation)
