Problem: Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the
appropriate prompts for the triangle’s base and height, and change the names of
the variables appropriately. Then, use the formula .5 * base * height to compute the area. Test the program from an IDLE window.
Solution:
    ....
"""
base = int(input("enter with base: "))
height = int(input("enter with height: "))
area = 5 + base * height
print("the area is", area, "triangular unit.")
