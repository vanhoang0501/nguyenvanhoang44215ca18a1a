Problem:
    Five Star Retro Video rents VHS tapes and DVDs to the same connoisseurs who
    like to buy LP record albums. The store rents new videos for $3.00 a night, and
    oldies for $2.00 a night. Write a program that the clerks at Five Star Retro Video
    can use to calculate the total charge for a customerâ€™s video rentals. The program
    should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total
    cost.
Solution:
    ....
"""
videos = int(input("Enter the number of new videos: "))
oldies = int(input("Enter the number of oldies: "))
result = videos + oldies
print("The total cost is", "$", result)
