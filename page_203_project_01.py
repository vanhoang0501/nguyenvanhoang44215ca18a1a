Problem:Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study 3.6) in a
function named newton. This function expects the input number as an argument
and returns the estimate of its square root. The script should also include a main
function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses
the enter/return key.
Solution:
    ....
"""
import math


def newton(x):
    tolerance = 0.000001
    estimate = 1.0
    while True:
        estimate = (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
        difference = abs(x - estimate ** 2)
        if difference <= tolerance:
            break
    return estimate


def main():
    while True:
        x = input("Enter a positive number or enter/return to quit: ")
        if x == '':
            break
        x = float(x)
        print("The program's estimate is", newton(x))
        print("Python's estimate is     ", math.sqrt(x))


main()
