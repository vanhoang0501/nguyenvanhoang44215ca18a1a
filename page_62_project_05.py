Problem:
    An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. Write a program
    that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as
    inputs and then outputs its momentum.
Solution:
    ....
"""
mass = float(input("Enter mass in kgs: "))
velocity = float(input("Enter velocity in m/s: "))
motivation = mass * velocity
print("motivation: ", motivation)
